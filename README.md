Welcome to Pokemon API Integration!


Providing a way to search for a specific pokemon and get a more extensive look at its information. This application uses Bootstrap to assist with styling to replicate the look of a pokeball's colors with the menus. This application also uses javascript to connect to the PokeAPI and retrieve data based on the user's search.

Searching for Pokemon - A simple search in the PokeAPI based on the name the user searches. It responds with an alert for an empty search box and providing feedback if the name they entered is not found in the database. If name is found it returns the pokemons ID and their front sprite.

Displaying the Details - Building on the 'search for the pokemon' this provides the same feedback to the user based on the input and whether the name is found in the database. However once the name is found it provides more information on the pokemon. It includes, Abilities, Types, and the Stats. The layout is done with bootstrap to keep things looking clean and easily readable.
